%% Read a sequence into MATLAB
%
% The |Sequence| class provides an implementation of the _open file
% format_ for MR sequences described here: http://pulseq.github.io/specification.pdf
%
% This example demonstrates parsing an MRI sequence stored in this format,
% accessing sequence parameters and visualising the sequence.

%% Read a sequence file
% A sequence can be loaded from the open MR file format using the |read|
% method.
%seq_name='gre.seq'; 
seq_name='epi_rs.seq';
%seq_name='trufi.seq'; 
%seq_name='epi_se.seq';
%seq_name='../tests/gre.seq';
%seq_name='../tests/epi_rs.seq';

sys = mr.opts('B0', 2.89); % we need system here if we want 'detectRFuse' to detect fat-sat pulses
seq=mr.Sequence(sys);
seq.read(seq_name,'detectRFuse');

%% sanity check to see if the reading and writing are consistent
% seq.write('read_test.seq');
% system(['diff -s -u ' seq_name ' read_test.seq'],'-echo');

%% Access sequence parameters and blocks
% Parameters defined with in the |[DEFINITIONS]| section of the sequence file
% are accessed with the |getDefinition| method. These are user-specified
% definitions and do not effect the execution of the sequence.
seqName=seq.getDefinition('Name')

%% calculate and display real TE, TR as well as slew rates and gradient amplitudes

rep = seq.testReport; 
fprintf([rep{:}]); 

%%
% Sequence blocks are accessed with the |getBlock| method. As shown in the
% output the first block is a selective excitation block and contains an RF
% pulse and gradient and on the z-channel.
b1=seq.getBlock(1)

%%
% Further information about each event can be obtained by accessing the
% appropriate fields of the block struct. In particular, the complex RF
% signal is stored in the field |signal|.
rf=b1.rf

figure;
subplot(211);
plot(rf.t,abs(rf.signal));
ylabel('RF magnitude');
subplot(212);
plot(1e3*rf.t,angle(rf.signal))
ylabel('RF phase'); xlabel('t (ms)');

%%
% The next three blocks contain: three gradient events; a delay; and
% readout gradient with ADC event, each with corresponding fields defining
% the details of the events.
b2 = seq.getBlock(2);
b3 = seq.getBlock(3);
b4 = seq.getBlock(4);
b2.gx
b3.delay
b4.adc


%% Plot the sequence 
% Visualise the sequence using the |plot| method of the class. This creates
% a new figure and shows ADC, RF and gradient events. The axes are linked
% so zooming is consistent. In this example, a simple gradient echo sequence
% for MRI is displayed.
seq.plot()
return
%%
% The details of individual pulses are not well-represented when the entire
% sequence is visualised. Interactive zooming is helpful here.
% Alternatively, a time range can be specified.  An additional parameter
% also allows the display units to be changed for easy reading. 
% Further, the handle of the created figure can be returned if required.
fig=seq.plot('TimeRange',[0 16e-3],'timeDisp','ms')

%% Modifying sequence blocks
% In addition to loading a sequence and accessing sequence blocks, blocks
% can be modified. In this example, a Hamming window is applied to the
% first RF pulse of the sequence and the flip angle is changed to 45
% degrees. The remaining RF pulses are unchanged. 

rf2=rf;
duration=rf2.t(end);
t=rf2.t-duration/2;                                 % Centre time about 0
alpha=0.5;
BW=4/duration;                                      % time bandwidth product = 4
window = (1.0-alpha+alpha*cos(2*pi*t/duration));    % Hamming window
signal = window.*sinc(BW*t);

% Normalise area to achieve 2*pi rotation
signal=signal./(seq.rfRasterTime*sum(real(signal)));

% Scale to 45 degree flip angle
rf2.signal=signal.*45/360;

b1.rf=rf2;
seq.setBlock(1,b1);

%% second check to see what we have changed
% seq.write('read_test2.seq');
% system(['diff -s -u ' seq_name ' read_test2.seq'],'-echo');


%%
% The amplitude of the first rf pulse is reduced due to the reduced
% flip-angle. Notice the reduction is not exactly a factor of two due to
% the windowing function.
amp1_in_Hz = max(abs(seq.getBlock(1).rf.signal))
amp2_in_Hz = max(abs(seq.getBlock(6).rf.signal))
